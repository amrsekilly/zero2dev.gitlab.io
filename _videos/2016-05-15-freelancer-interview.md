I usually have a rule to not work for a month before my finals exams in college. It's not just to help me study, but also to keep my rating on [Freelancer.com](http://freelancer.com) safe and to isolate it from the worries that might be caused by the exams.

For me, freelancing on that platform has more to do with building a reputation and gaining experience than making money. I personally consider it a paid education!

Couple of weeks ago, I was just checking my dashboard when I found an [ad for a video contest that's organized by Freelancer.com's team](https://www.freelancer.com/contest/Tell-us-how-Freelancercom-has-changed-your-life-and-win-Winners-399872.html).

When I opened the contest, I was very astonished after reading the brief. It required us to upload a video of 3-5 minutes in which we get to tell our success story on Freelancer.com.

The 20 winners will then be awarded a monetary award, in addition to featuring their stories in the "Freelancer.com hitting 20 million users" celebration video!

That was just incredible to read; as I was just preparing to pause my freelancing work until I'm done with the exams. Also, at this point I had completed 6 successful projects with a 5-stars rating!

So, I had to make a choice. Opportunities like these only come once in a lifetime. That's when I asked my friend [Seif](https://www.facebook.com/Swod.Seif.Epee) who happened to be a professional videographer an Engineering student to help me with the video.

In a week I had written a good transcript and got it reviewed by a [professional editor](https://www.fiverr.com/alecross). Then we started searching for a place to shoot the video.

That's when we came across [Workstation](http://workstation-eg.co/). The place was astounding, I didn't believe that this place was in Egypt until we went there ourselves and shot the video!

I've worked in some co-working spaces in Alexandria, EG before. But, this place is really amazing. The staff was very friendly and the manager allowed us to film the interview in the shared working space!

After getting all the videos shot, I went home and [I started editing the whole thing on iMovie](https://www.instagram.com/p/BFb8N67zCCV/?taken-by=amrsekilly).

Then, I published it to YouTube. And, [I submitted my entry to the contest](https://www.freelancer.com/contest/Tell-us-how-Freelancercom-has-changed-your-life-and-win-Winners-399872-byentry-9070658.html). I'm still waiting for the final results.

But, this experience was priceless! It enabled me to know a lot about other freelancers across the globe. And, it inspired me; because now I know that there are many other people in different countries doing what I do. and that's just amazing!
