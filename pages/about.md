[I](https://amrsekilly.com) realized that everyday I'm learning a new thing on [Coursera](https://coursera.org) or [FreeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.com). The key thing that helped me learn on these platforms was the availability of a community.

Unfortunately, I'm not sharing anything that I've learned or is learning with anyone. Especially now, when I've already started my career as a [freelance web developer](https://www.freelancer.com/u/amrsekilly.html) using the knowledge that I've acquired from learning on these platforms.

That's why I think it's time for me to start sharing my journey with the community in the form of a weekly Vlogs.

I'll use this Vlog for two purposes:    
1- Summarizing what I'm doing every week, what I'm studying and the freelancing work that I'm working on.    
2- Offering some tips that I've acquired while working as a freelance web developer, that might help other freelancers who are just starting out.

I don't expect any outcomes from this vlog, I'm not even sure if it will continue in the future. But, I'll enjoy creating the vlogs and I hope that you enjoy watching them as well!
